# Fast Food Kubernetes

! Early alpha. Don't read this. It's not ready yet.

This tutorial shows you how to set up a Kubernetes cluster without any public clouds, like on a PC hidden deep inside your grandmother's cellar or WWII bunker. An ideal tutorial for a classic bare metal Andy.

I'm not too fond of the console and terminals. We will use GUI, IDE, Ansible, Python, and other modern tools - YouTube videos included.

## Inspiration

This guide is inspired by Kelsey Hightower's [Kubernetes The Hard Way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way).

I found that the original guide is too hard to follow because we have very different approaches to tooling and learning. Kelsey's point is to use clouds, and console, and tons of text.

On the other hand, I'm a more visual type of person. I prefer not to deal with clouds when possible, and I hate bash.
